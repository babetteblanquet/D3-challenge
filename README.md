# D3-challenge

This project is about creating a scatter plot with D3.js.

The scatter plot shows the percentage of smokers versus the average age of the population in the United States in 2014.
You can visualise the visualisation here: https://babetteblanquet.github.io/D3-challenge/

Here are the files you will find in this repository:
- the app.js - javascript code creating the scatter plot 
- index.html - the webpage
- data.csv - the data
- a folder named 'assets' where the css files are located.
